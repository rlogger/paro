## design: removes pâro when ordering food delivery
**pâro** n. the feeling that everything you do is always somehow wrong

<br>

**Status:** Inactive Development - See known limitations

POC: Simple 2-page mobile app with preset food ordering options based on cuisine selection. Backend API integration with Uber Eats for real-time delivery quotes and order placement.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

**Third-Party API Access**: Delivery platform APIs (Uber Eats, DoorDash) are not publicly available to individual developers. Access requires enterprise partnerships or formal commercial agreements, making this project non-deployable for personal use without alternative solutions.
